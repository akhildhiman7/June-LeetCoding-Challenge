/*
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the weight of index i(0-indexed), write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
For example, given an input list of values [1, 9], when we pick up a number out of it, the chance is that 9 times out of 10 we should pick the number 9 as the answer.

Example 1:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output
[null,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. Since there is only one single element on the array the only option is to return the first element.
Example 2:

Input
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output
[null,1,1,1,1,0]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 3]);
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1. It's returning the second element (index = 1) that has probability of 3/4.
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 1
solution.pickIndex(); // return 0. It's returning the first element (index = 0) that has probability of 1/4.

Constraints:
1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
